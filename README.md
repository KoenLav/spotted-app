# React Native WebView Javascript Bridge with a Meteor App


A simple proof-of-concept app which shows the communication between React Native and Javascript inside a Webview running a Meteor App.



## Configuration

1. change the constant METEOR_APP_URI to the uri that your MeteorApp is running.

```java
const METEOR_APP_URI = "http://192.168.1.104:3000"
```

## Notes

I'm just playing around with the libraries to see what I can do. Don't take it too seriously, for now :)
