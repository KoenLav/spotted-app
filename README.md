###What is Spotted?

Spotted is an app where you can share a thought, an outburst, express yourself throught a catchphrase or even ask who was that red-shirt person in the math class this morning ;) All of this anonymously! You can also interact with the closest (<250km) posts from you, with likes and comments, also in complete anonymity, of course!


###Breakthrough

My idea was to create a web application that looks native and with all, or almost all, features of a native app (such as camera, geo-location, get unique device identifier, store presence etc). For this, I used Meteor for the web application and React Native to load the meteor app through a webview, using WebViewBridge to communicate between the two sides.

I invested a lot of time in the layout, to make it very convincing that the user is using a native application.

Everything in pure scss + javascript
